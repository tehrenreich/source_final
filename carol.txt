Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a
One horse open sleigh
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one
Horse open sleigh

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a
One horse open sleigh
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one
Horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the hills we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on Bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
